---------------------------------------

* Color
* Absolutely 100% Free Software (licensed under the GPL 2.0)

Fiddling with the Source
---------------------------------------

You'll need a working editor.

You can change the resolution by changing:
im=Image.new('RGB',(160,160),(255,255,255))
to:
im=Image.new('RGB',(640,480),(255,255,255)) # this creates a 640 by 480

You can change the image format by changing:
filename= "image%03d.png"%recordnum
to:
filename= "image%03d.jpg"%recordnum # creates jpg images

If you're messing with the source, then maybe you want to help.  If you have
any problems, feel free to email me at drasch@users.sourceforge.net .

Also, if you plan to do anything with Tessellation, be it coding, 
translations, or whatever, please use the latest (CVS) copy.  
It can be found on:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/tesselation/


Miscellaneous Notes
------------------------------
  ** The standard "it runs fine for me" disclaimer applies.  I've tested it a
     lot myself, but you can never predict everything.  Still, there's no
     oddball hacking involved so I think the chance of catastophic Palm
     explosion should be small indeed.  This is not to say that it won't ever
     crash/hang, but if it does...
