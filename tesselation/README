A tessellation is a mosaic pattern.

Fiddling with the Source
---------------------------------------

You'll need a suitable Palm development environment, Tessellation was created with Palm SDK 3.5, so you'll need a copy of that too.

You should look in the Makefile to make sure the program names and paths are ok.
"make"
You should now have tessellation.prc.

If you're messing with the source, then maybe you want to help.  If you have
any problems, feel free to email me at drasch@xs4all.nl .  Also, if you
plan to do anything with Tessellation, be it coding, translations, or whatever,
please use the latest (CVS) copy.  It can be found on:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/tesselation/

Miscellaneous Notes
------------------------------
  ** The standard "it runs fine for me" disclaimer applies.  I've tested it a
     lot myself, but you can never predict everything.  Still, there's no
     oddball hacking involved so I think the chance of catastophic Palm
     explosion should be small indeed.  This is not to say that it won't ever
     crash/hang, but if it does...
